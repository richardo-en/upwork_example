    <p class = "des-text ml-3 ">I choosed to learn flask with python. For build site in this programm i 
    need to know python , html , sqlite3 (database) and as last i have to know some style language like
    css but i use framework. I can use bootstrap 5 or tailwind which i used on this site now.

    <h3 class = "des-tit mt-15 mr-7">Why would you choose site from me?</h3>
    <br>
    <p class = "des-text mr-3 float-right ">If you will have site where you have to
    regularly upload some files edit them , delete or do whatever you need to do with them without writing "comma of code"
    you may contact me. Because i'm using sqlite3 database i can save into database whatever i want images , pdf's , 
    text's and more. Than i display them where you need them to be displayed.

    <h3 class = "des-tit mt-5 ml-7">How does work part of site with article?</h3>
    <br>
    <p class = "des-text ml-3 "> Well first of all you have to be logged in. If you sign in 
    navigational bar automaticly shows more options like Admin or Add text. Add text will open part of site
    with online text editor where you can edit text as in word but there aren't that much options obviously.
    This editor is imported via WYSIWYG (bootstrap) but you can switch that to code mode and if you have some 
    experience with bootstrap or tailwind you can design it by yourself. This means you will have tons of design options.
    In the admin page you are able to see all your uploaded articles and remove just one concrete or remove all of them
     just by clicking button.

    <h3 class = "des-tit mr-7 mb-2">How about time?</h3>
    <br>
    <p class = "des-text mr-3 float-right ">Well sadly this will take more time than 
    other sellers just in case i m beginner also dont have that much free time but i'll try my best. If order will
    be late i will contact you to tell you how is it "standing" or you should offer me less money. In the end i m doing
    this just in case to be better in programming and learn something.
